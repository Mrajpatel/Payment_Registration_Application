# Payment_Registration_Application
This application demonstrates payment method using Stripe API and for verification it uses Twilio API. All the created users are stored in MySQL database.

USE Twilio registration funcation works only on registred number, which I cannot provide in public. It will work perfectly with any registraed number.
